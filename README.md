# Clustering-Classification-Project
ML project: Clustering &amp; Classification. Identify clusters &amp; predict classes. Explore patterns via Streamlit. Python, Scikit-learn.

This project aims to implement machine learning techniques for both clustering and classification tasks. It consists of two main tasks: Clustering and Classification.

Task 1: Clustering
In this task, we utilize clustering techniques to extract patterns and segregate data into groups. The program accepts data points (rows) and identifies which cluster the given data point belongs to and provides explanations for the clustering assignment. Various clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering can be employed for this task but in this respective project I use K-means algorithm.

Task 2: Classification
For the classification task, we train classification models on the training dataset and evaluate their performance on the test dataset. The models are trained to predict the labels or classes of the input data points based on the features provided. Common classification algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Decision Trees can be explored and compared for their accuracy and efficiency and the output is stored in a csv file by all the algorithms.

Output Representation:
The results and output of the clustering and classification tasks are displayed using either a Streamlit web application. The web interface allows users to interact with the trained models, input data points, and observe the clustering assignments or classification predictions. Visualizations and explanations are provided to enhance the understanding of the model's behavior.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
    Streamlit for web application development
    GitHub for version control and project management
